# Dynamics
This repository contains code which i created, used and updated before I get my Master's degree.

Studienarbeit came from a short essay in which I presented features of micro-slip model, including analytical one-bar model, discrete one-bar model and the brush model. Analytical one-bar model is derivated with the instructions from this book:

Many thanks to Professor Csaba.

The other two models use numerical methods and is much simpler to understand.
